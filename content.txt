1.class and obj(example)
2.class has data/attribute and func/methods
    >code walkthrough
    >attribute get called itself,methods are called manually
3.why Python is called OOPs?.everything in Python is  an oject (data structure,data type etc)
4.Advantage of OOPS:
    > you can create your own datatype
    >code reusability
    >debuging
    >easy to colab

5. End to end project (chatbook class)
    >function vs method
    >magic method or dunder method (constructor)
    >self
    > You can create attribute outside class as well

    > encapsulation
    > getter and setter
    > static method 
    
6. Inheritance
    >Inheritance code example
    >Why Inheritance is neede?(code reusability,parent has no access to child class)
    > constructor overloading & method overloading
    >Super keyword(can be used only inside class,can not access variable/attribute,used only inside child class)

    >Types of Inheritance-1.Single Inheritance | 2. Multilevel | 3. Hierarchical | 4.Multiple <Diamond Problem> | 5. Hybrid
